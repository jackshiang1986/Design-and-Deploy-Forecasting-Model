# Design and Deploy Forecasting Model

For this project the mtcars dataset will be used for the study. The data of mtcars is contained in a csv file. These data are derived car manufacturer information published by the Department of Transport. In this project, linear regression model will be utilized in both R program and Azure Machine Learning (AML) environment.

The objectives of the project are to: 
  1. Develop an R-script using RStudio to create a linear model to forecast the mpg of automobiles
  2. Perform the same activities on Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio
