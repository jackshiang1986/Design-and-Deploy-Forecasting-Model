# Design-and-Deploy-Forecasting-Model

For this project the mtcars dataset will be used for the study. The data of mtcars is contained in a csv file. These data are derived car manufacturer information published by the Department of Transport. In this project, linear regression model will be utilized in both R program and Azure Machine Learning (AML) environment.

The data set, “mtcars.csv”, was provided. The data was from the 1974 Motor Trend US Magazine and comprises fuel consumption in miles per gallon (mpg) and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973-74 models). 

The objectives of the project are to: 
- develop an R-script using RStudio to create a linear model to forecast the mpg of automobiles; and
- perform the same activities on Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio
